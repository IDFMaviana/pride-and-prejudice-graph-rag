Miss Bingley attempts to poison Elizabeth’s view of Wickham and defend Darcy. Jane and Bingley's relationship appears to flourish, while Elizabeth intervenes with Mr. Collins to prevent a social blunder, to no avail. The ball continues with comic family embarrassments—Mary’s singing, Mrs. Bennet’s indiscreet boasting about Jane’s future marriage to Bingley, and Mr. Collins’s speeches.

As gossip spreads, Lady Lucas repeatedly visits Longbourn, delighting in her daughter's good fortune to Mrs. Bennet's increasing discomfort. The engagement causes strain in Elizabeth and Charlotte's friendship, with mutual restraint and loss of confidence between them. Against this backdrop, Jane and Elizabeth struggle with anxiety over Bingley's absence, the uncertainty heightened by the silence from Netherfield and Jane's correspondence with Caroline Bingley.

The Gardiners, Mrs. Bennet’s brother and his wife, arrive at Longbourn for Christmas, bringing gifts and cosmopolitan conversation. Mrs. Bennet vents about the Lucas marriage and her daughters’ marital disappointments, focusing on Jane’s missed opportunity with Mr. Bingley and Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins. Mrs. Gardiner steers the family conversation away from grievances and later privately consoles Elizabeth and suggests Jane visit London for distraction. Elizabeth is pleased and reflects on the nature of Bingley's attachment. The Gardiners’ stay includes frequent social engagements, many with Mr. Wickham, prompting Mrs. Gardiner to observe Elizabeth’s interest in him with some caution. Mrs. Gardiner and Wickham discuss Derbyshire and Pemberley, connecting over shared acquaintances and forming opinions about Mr. Darcy.",
